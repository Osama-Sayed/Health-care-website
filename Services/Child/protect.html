Vaccinate your child according to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule for safe, proven disease protection.</b> <br><br> Diseases that vaccine prevent can be very serious—even deadly—especially for infants and young children. Vaccines reduce your child’s risk of infection by working with their body’s natural defenses to help them safely develop immunity to disease. Immunizations have helped improve the health of children in the United States. Most parents today have never seen first-hand the devastating consequences that vaccine-preventable diseases have on a family or community. Although most of these diseases are not common in the United States, they still exist around the world, so it is important to protect your child with vaccines. <br> <br> <b>Protect Your Child from Serious Diseases</b><br><br> One example of the seriousness of vaccine-preventable diseases is the increase in whooping cough (pertussis) cases and outbreaks reported over the last few decades. In 2016, more than 17,000 cases of whooping cough were reported to CDC. Whooping cough can be deadly, especially for young babies who are too young to get their own vaccines. Since 2010, there have been tens of thousands of whooping cough cases reported each year nationwide, with a peak of more than 48,000 cases reported in 2012. One recent study showed that many whooping cough deaths among babies could be prevented if all babies received the first dose on time at 2 months old, when they are old enough to get vaccinated.<br><br> Measles cases and outbreaks still occur in the United States. Thanks to an effective vaccine, measles isn’t as common in the U.S. anymore, but it still a common disease in many parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Measles is brought into the United States by unvaccinated U.S. residents and visitors who get infected when they are in other countries. Measles can spread easily when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated. The disease can be serious and can cause pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and even death. Young children are at highest risk for serious complications from measles.

The recommended schedule is designed to protect infants and children early in life, when they are most vulnerable and before they are exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases. <br><br>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/child.html">recommended immunization schedule for babies </a>  includes vaccination protection against all of the following diseases: <br> <br> <b>The Diseases Vaccines Prevent</b> <br><br> <ol> <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/diseases/child/hib.html">Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)</a></li>

             </ol> <br><br> <b>Vaccinate On Time, Every Time</b> <br><br> Even though there are outbreaks of some vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States, the spread of disease usually slows or stops because most people are vaccinated or protected through immunity against the disease. If we stopped vaccinating, even the few cases we have in this country could very quickly become tens or hundreds of thousands of cases.

Fortunately, most parents choose to vaccinate their children and immunization rates in this country are at or near record high levels. In fact, less than 1 percent of children do not receive any vaccines. However, some children have not received all of their vaccines, so they are not fully protected. It’s important that children receive all doses of the vaccines according to the recommended immunization schedule. Not receiving all doses of a vaccine leaves a child vulnerable to catching serious diseases.

That’s why it’s important to make sure that your child is up to date on his immunizations. Call your pediatrician to find out if your child is due for any vaccinations. </p>
